The problem with schools

My teaching experience in different parts of the world convinced me that something is wrong with english education.
Everywhere I went it was the same situation.
The students were bored, frustrated, stressed and nervous.
Most students even after years of studying English failed to speak the language fluently.
You are not alone because it's a global problem.
One of my students Saeco from Japan described this combination of failure and stress as English drama.
Saeco said that she haited english.
She felt that learning English was boring and stressful and speaking english was even worse.
In fact the thought of speaking to a native speaker immediately made Saeco feel extremely nervous and shy.
Saeco felt she had developed the psychological problem with english and had named it 'English drama'.

A drama is a deep wound or injury.
How said I thought to myself that so many peole now thik of English as kind of injury or mental {desease}.
Trought out my teaching career I've met many students who had similar feelings about English.
I {discovered} that Saeco was not alone.
Rather English drama is a global epidemic.
The most people feel they must lear to speak english very few seem to enjoy it.
Most who learned the language struggle with the same feelings of nervousness and frustration that Saeco had.
As I encountered this problem more and more I began to look for the root causes.
I realized that before I found a solution I needed to understand the problem.
Just as a doctor
