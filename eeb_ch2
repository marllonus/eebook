Chapter 2

The problem with schools

My teaching experience in different parts of the world convinced me that somethind is wrong with english education.
Everywhere I went it's the same situation.
The students were bored, frustrated, stressed and nervous.
Most students even after years of studying English failed to speak the language fluently.
You are not alone because it's a global problem.
One of my students Saeco from Japan described this combination of failure and stress as English drama.
Saeco said she haited english.
She felt that learning English was boring and stressful and speaking english was even worse.
In fact the taught?? of speaking to a native speaker immediately made Saeco fill extremely nervous and shy.
