Chapter 2

The problem with schools

My teaching experience in different parts of the world convinced me that something is wrong with english education.
Everywhere I went it was the same situation.
The students were bored, frustrated, stressed and nervous.
Most students even after years of studying English failed to speak the language fluently.
You are not alone because it's a global problem.
One of my students Saeco from Japan described this combination of failure and stress as English drama.
Saeco said that she haited english.
She felt that learning English was boring and stressful and speaking english was even worse.
In fact the thought of speaking to a native speaker immediately made Saeco feel extremely nervous and shy.
Saeco felt she had developed the psychological problem with english and had named it 'English drama'.

A drama is a deep wound or injury.
How said I thought to myself that so many people now think of English as kind of injury or mental {desease}.
Trought out my teaching career I've met many students who had similar feelings about English.
I {discovered} that Saeco was not alone.
Rather English drama is a global epidemic.
The most people feel they must lear to speak english very few seem to enjoy it.
Most who learned the language struggle with the same feelings of nervousness and frustration that Saeco had.
As I encountered this problem more and more I began to look for the root causes.
I realized that before I found a solution I needed to understand the problem.
Just as a doctor must first diagnoste a desease before {treating} it.
Think about it.
What is the cause of all of this {misery} and failure?
Why do so many people fail to speak English effortlesly despite years of study?
What is wrong with english education?
The first and most obvious problem I found with schools was the way in which they teach English.
Most schools everewhere in the world use the grammar translation method.
As the name {implies} the focus of this method is on grammar analisys and the memorisation of translated vocabulary.
This method brakes English in to an endless series grammar formulas to memorise.
Of course, each grammar formula has exceptions and this must be memorise too.
Schools like the grammar translation method because it {appears} to be serious, academic and complex.
The grammar translation method fits the way schools teach most subjects:
with textbooks, lectures, notes, memorisation and tests.
The only problem as you know is that it doesn't work.
In real conversations there simply is no time to think about grammar formulas and their exceptions. (3:11)

The failure rate for this method {therefore} is absolutely horrible.
Despite the failure of most students to speak English fluently schools continued to use this mehod.
This is an epic failure of our education sustem.
{Recently} because students find the grammar translation method so boring
some schools have added communication activities to their {curriculum}.
{Accaisionally} the teacher puts the students in to pairs or groups.
The students then read or repeat dialogs from a textbook.
Sometimes they might answer a few questions from a worksheet.
Of cccourse this activities're unnatural nothing like real English conversation.
{Consequently} the {failure} rate the communication activities is just as bad as grammar translation.
Obviosly the English teaching methods used in schools do not work.
That was easy to see.
I knew it, the students knew it and many teachers knew it too the few will admit it. (4:09)
Howewer, as I continued to investigate the problem with schools.
I found even deeper problems in the education system.
This problems are less obvious but in many ways far more damaging to the students.
I call this problems 'the hidden curriculum'.
Because they are the hidden lessons taught by schools.

The hidden curriculum.
Most schools everywhere in the world share similar hidden curriculum.
One element of this curriculum is student passivity.
In schools students are trained to be passive not active.
They sit in chairs in rows??.
When they're young they're told?? to be quiet and obey the teacher.
As the teacher lectures the students take notes.
Later they're told to memorise this notes and preparetion for a test.
The message is clear.
Learning is a passive activity. (5:09)
