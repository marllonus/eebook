Gladess was determine to speak english  well.
Talk about effort. Gladess attended every one of my classes.
She always set in the center of the front row.
I can still picture her igre?? and smiling face.
She took detailed notes.
She listend to every word I sad.
She also studied at home.
Every day Gladess studied her english textbooks for for hours or more.
She also try to learn 50 new wocabulary words by memorising word lists.
Gladess was my star student.
And I too was sure she would succeed.
6 months later hovever she still could {barely} speak english.
Her speach was {hesitant} and unnatural.
She constantly make grammar mistakes with even the simplest sentences.
Her prononciation was difficult to understand.
She still thought in spanish and {try to translate two and from english} when she spoke.
First of all Gladess felt nervous every time she try to speak english.
Speaking english was a painfull experience for her.
Gladess was extremely frustrated.
After so much effort she had barely improved.
As her teacher I too was frustrated.
I was sure Gladess would improve quickly and couldn't understand why she had not. (5:03)

I followed all of the traditional teaching methods.
I used the standards textbooks and the standard classroom activities.
Gladess was intelligent, disciplined and {consistent} and yet her english speaking barely improved.
Sadly I {realize} the Gladess wasn't the only one who had not improved.
Her classmates also had barely improved.
It was frustrating and I felt like a complete failure as a teacher.
But when I asked my collegs for help it turned out they had the same problem.
Wery few of their students were improving {eighter}.
At that point I realizing something was wrong, something is wrong with standard methods for teaching english.
The worst part for me was that every one accepted this situation as normal.
The other teachers didn't seen to be {concerned} about their students {lack} of progress.
All the teachers were using the same methods and getting the same poor results. (6:02)

In most parts of the world students study english in school for years.
Yet the {vast} majority over them never learn to speak english well.
After years of study they still have trouble with real english conversations.
They still feel nervous and about speaking.
A few year after my experience with Gladess I got a job as an english teaching assistent in Japan.
I was excited and igor?? to help this yong students lern my language.
I still remember my first day. (6:36)
